**Synchronize a local directory of video files to remote streaming services.**

<!-- /short-description -->

> \[!WARNING]\
> This tool was built in haste and has been tested only against a relatively narrow use-case. If you use it, please review the docs, invoke with care, and make sure you have local copies of your remote videos and metadata.

## Overview

Vidup is a CLI tool and Node library to automate one-way synchronization of local video files to remote video streaming CDN services.

It checks for differences between your local and remote videos, and automatically creates, updates, or deletes videos on the remote service so that it exactly mirrors the contents of a local directory.

Currently, only Bunny.net's [Bunny Stream](https://bunny.net/stream/) service is supported as a sync target. Adding support additional platforms like [Mux](https://www.mux.com) and [Cloudflare Stream](https://www.cloudflare.com/products/cloudflare-stream/) wouldn't be too tricky.

## Getting started

### Dependencies

The vidup CLI tool requires Node 18+. The exported APIs for are ESM-only and share the Node 18+ requirement. Vidup is implemented in TypeScript and bundles type definitions.

A [Bunny Stream](https://bunny.net/stream/) account, API key, and library ID are required.

### Installation

Invoke directly:

```sh
npx vidup
```

Or, install locally to access the CLI commands in a single project or to import the provided APIs:

```sh
npm install vidup
```

Or, install globally for access across your system:

```sh
npm install --global vidup
```

## Usage

Vidup treats local videos' file names as keys, and will look for a file with the same name / title on the remote streaming service.

Any video files present in the local folder that aren't matched to a video on the remote service will be uploaded.

If you change the name of a local video file, the remote video with the previous name will be deleted, and a new remote video (with a ne GUID) will be created.

Vidup tracks the content hash of each local video. If you replace a local video file with another of the same name, the change in content will be detected and the remote video will be updated.
(_Note that this is currently equivalent to deleting / creating a new remote video since Bunny.net doesn't support in-place video updates. The GUID will change, so you'll need to update any embeds accordingly._)

Any videos present on the remote service that aren't matched to a video file in the local folder **will be deleted from the remote service**.

<!-- /cli-help -->

#### Examples

**Synchronize video files in the current folder to Bunny Stream:**

```sh
vidup . --service bunny --key <BUNNY_API_KEY> --library <BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID>
```

Large uploads can take some time. Upon completion, a report summarizing the actions taken is printed to stdout:

```sh
None: an-already-uploaded-video.mov
Create: a-new-video.mov
Update: a-changed-video.mp4
Delete: a-remote-only-video.mp4
```

**Perform a non-executive dry run and get the synchronization plan report as JSON:**

```sh
vidup . --json --dry-run --service bunny --key <BUNNY_API_KEY> --library <BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID>
```

The JSON version of the output provides some extra info.

### Library

#### API

Vidup's functionality is also provided in module form for use in TypeScript or JavaScript Node projects.

The library exports `syncVideoInDirectory`, which takes an options argument mirroring the arguments available via the command line and returns an object reporting the synchronization steps performed:

```ts
async function syncVideoInDirectory(
  directory: string,
  options: {
    service: Service
    credentials: {
      key: string
      library: string
    }
    dryRun?: boolean // defaults to false
    verbose?: boolean // defaults to false
  },
): Promise<SyncReport>
```

A `stripVideoMetadataInDirectory` function is also exported, which will remove metadata from all videos in the target directory. It returns a list of video filepaths with metadata:

```ts
export async function stripVideoMetadataInFiles(
  directory: string,
  options: {
    dryRun?: boolean // defaults to false
    verbose?: boolean // defaults to false
  },
): Promise<string[]>
```

#### Examples

```ts
import { syncVideoInDirectory } from 'vidup'

const syncReport = await syncVideoInDirectory(process.cwd(), {
  service: 'bunny',
  credentials: {
    key: BUNNY_API_KEY,
    library: BUNNY_LIBRARY_ID,
  },
})

console.log(JSON.stringify(syncReport, undefined, 2))
```

## Background

### Motivation

Video streaming providers have slow and clunky web UIs. I'd rather not maintain the remote collection by hand. The web these days makes Finder.app feel like a CRUD tour-de-force.

## The future

- [ ] Tests
- [ ] Add [Cosmiconfig](https://github.com/cosmiconfig/cosmiconfig)
- [ ] Synchronize thumbnails and other metadata
- [ ] Remote collection / folder support
- [ ] Mux support
- [ ] Cloudflare Stream support
- [ ] Support for additional streaming services
